# Simple-Calculator-in-OOP

This program is a redo of my [Simple App Calculator](https://github.com/DaleMenciro/Simple-App-Calculator) but in OOP.
## This program is divided into four files:
    ui_calculator.py - handles the GUI of the program
    operation_calculator.py - handles the arithmetic operations.
    main_calculator.py - serves as the entry point of the program
    additional_operations_calculator.py - handles additional arithmetic operations.

1. This program will ask the user to choose one of the arithmetic operations:
- **Addition**
- **Subtraction**
- **Multiplication**
- **Division**

2. After that the user may input two(2) numbers to perform the selected arithmetic operation.

3. The program has a clear, try again, and exit button for them to choose while using the program.
- **Clear** - the input fields and result will be cleared
- **Try Again** - message box will display to input another values
- **Exit** - the program exits and messagebox will display 

4. The program has Python Function and appropriate Exceptions to capture errors during runtime.
